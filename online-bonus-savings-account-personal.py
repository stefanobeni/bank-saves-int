    OBSA stands for Online Bonus Savings Account. It is a savings account offered by HSBC where the interest rate is
    higher if you do not withdraw money from that account for that month (as per 03/02/24 it is 4.00% vs 2.00%).

    The function assumes no income. The function also assumes that money taken out of the OBSA will be deposited into
    the Flexible Savings Account (FSA), so interest accumulates in that way too.

    Example:
    If

    :param OBSA_deposit:
    :param FSA_deposit:
    :param mnthly:
    :param out_rt:          --- This is the withdrawal rate. In other words it is the number of months you withdraw
                                money for in the event that you withdraw.
                                Example:
                                If out_rt == 2, it means that you will withdraw money once every 2 months. It also means
                                that when you do withdraw money, you withdraw the money that you need for 2 months.
